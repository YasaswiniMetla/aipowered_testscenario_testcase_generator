Feature: User Authentication System

Description:
The application provides a secure user authentication system allowing users to register, login, and manage their accounts. The system implements industry-standard security practices including password hashing, session management, and account lockout protection.

Business Rules:
- Users must provide a valid email address for registration
- Passwords must be at least 8 characters long with at least one uppercase, one lowercase, one number, and one special character
- Account is locked after 3 consecutive failed login attempts
- Locked accounts can be unlocked via email verification or after 30 minutes
- User sessions expire after 30 minutes of inactivity
- Password reset links are valid for 1 hour
- Users can enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for additional security
- Login attempts are rate-limited to 5 attempts per minute per IP address

Acceptance Criteria:
- AC1: Users can successfully register with valid credentials
- AC2: Users can login with correct email and password
- AC3: System displays appropriate error messages for invalid credentials
- AC4: Account locks after 3 failed attempts and displays lockout message
- AC5: Password reset email is sent within 1 minute
- AC6: Sessions automatically expire after 30 minutes of inactivity
- AC7: 2FA verification works correctly when enabled
- AC8: Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
