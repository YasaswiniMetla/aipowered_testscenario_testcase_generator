Feature: Inventory Management System

Description:
The system provides real-time inventory tracking for products across warehouses. It supports stock adjustments, low-stock alerts, automatic reordering, and synchronization with the order management and supplier systems. All updates must be atomic to prevent inconsistencies caused by simultaneous operations.

Business Rules:
- Every product must have a unique SKU.
- Stock quantity must always remain ≥ 0.
- Low-stock threshold is configurable per product.
- Inventory updates must be logged with timestamp, user, and action reason.
- Automatic reorder is triggered when stock falls below threshold.
- Reorder quantity is calculated based on 30-day sales average.
- Stock transfers between warehouses require approval when quantity > 50 units.
- Product availability in UI must reflect real-time stock after every update.
- A product cannot be marked “Out of Stock” if reorder is pending.

Acceptance Criteria:
- AC1: Users can update stock quantities manually.
- AC2: System shows accurate live inventory across all warehouses.
- AC3: Low-stock alerts must appear within 5 seconds of threshold breach.
- AC4: Automatic reorder requests are generated correctly.
- AC5: Stock cannot drop below zero regardless of API load.
- AC6: Stock transfer approval workflow functions correctly.
- AC7: Inventory logs display full action history.
- AC8: Product UI reflects updates within 3 seconds.

Technical Notes:
- Backend: Node.js microservices
- Database: MongoDB + Redis for caching
- Real-time updates powered by WebSockets
- Integration with Supplier API for purchase orders
- CRON job for nightly reconciliation
- Write operations use optimistic concurrency (versioning)

User Stories:
- As an operations manager, I want to update stock levels immediately when products arrive.
- As a warehouse staff member, I want alerts when stock reaches low levels.
- As a business owner, I want automatic reorders so items never go out of stock.
- As an admin, I want to approve large stock transfers.
